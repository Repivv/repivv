Ilaria Alpi, a 32-year-old Italian journalist, and her cameraman Miran were driving back to Mogadishu from Bosaso, a port city in the north of Somalia. It's March 1994. Operation Restore Hope is over. Five months ago was the Battle of Mogadishu, also known as Black Hawk Down, and the U.S.-led coalition troops are packing up and going home from their unfinished mission, leaving the country retribalized and in ruin.

Ilaria Alpi is there ostensibly to cover the Italian withdrawal from Somalia. Ilaria and Miran are just a few meters out from the Italian embassy when a Land Rover swerves in front of their Toyota pickup, and a commando of gunmen jumps out, brandishing Kalashnikovs. It's unclear what exactly happens next—a burst of gunfire—but miraculously, the hired driver and bodyguard are unharmed. Ilaria and Miran are killed. Her body is pulled out of the back of the white Jeep, covered in blood, by an Italian-born Somali resident who goes by one name: Giancarlo. As international press swarms the scene, Giancarlo pockets the journalist's notebooks and says they were somewhere they shouldn't have been.

But where were they? They had just returned from meeting the Sultan of Bosaso, Abdullahi Musa Bogor, also known as King Kong, who had agreed to talk to Alpi about the Italian-Somali fishing company SHIFCO—the Somali High Seas Fishing Company. SHIFCO, Alpi suspected, was potentially at the center of an illegal weapons and waste trafficking line, one that spanned across Europe, through the Mediterranean, across the continent, and straight to the Horn of Africa. The scope of the operation would require a lot of different hands: warlords, arms brokers, European firms, British banks, stay-behind intelligence operations, the Mafia, and the CIA. All of this would have to get pieced together later.

Somalia had been used as a dumping ground for hazardous waste since at least the early '90s: chemical, industrial, bio—you name it. Everything from cadmium and mercury to radioactive waste and uranium. And this stuff was making people sick—so sick, in fact, that pirates would famously take up where any semblance of a Somali government wouldn't: to patrol the waters, to get something back from the looting of their sea, and to set up shop making a buck off the poverty of Somalia, a place where Western governments and multinationals orchestrate chaos to manage streams of profits. And anyone who goes looking—from journalists and videographers to Coast Guard investigators and Gladio officers—all mysteriously turn up dead.

In the next episodes, we're going to walk through this story, including the unsolved murder of Ilaria Alpi, but starting at the beginning with a little history of Somalia, why it became so important to Italy, what happened when the U.S. got involved, why it's such a key hub for intelligence officers, warlords, weapon dealers, and just what all this has to do with pirates.

"Okay, so my first question is, Somalia is in Africa?"

"Yes."

"Where is Somalia? We should start there."

"No, no, no. Let's start this. What is Africa?"

"Okay, so Somalia is on the east coast of Africa. Picture Africa. You've got the west coast, the south where the white men are, the north where it's kind of Italian up there too—you know, Libya, Egypt—and then you've got the east. And on the little Horn of Africa, there are a few different countries, some bigger than others, and one of those is Somalia."

"Yeah. Ethiopia is to its west, Djibouti is the little guy to the north, Kenya you've got to the south."

"Somalia has the longest coastline on the mainland, which is an important thing. It's up against the Indian Ocean right there. It makes it very key for trade, for strategic geopolitical reasons. It's right on the edge."

"Yeah, and across the Gulf of Aden up there, you've got Yemen, and then Oman, and then you've got the Gulf and all that kind of stuff. It's in a pretty good spot. You've got the Indian Ocean that goes into the Gulf of Aden, and then you go up straight to the Red Sea. It's a really important strategic shipping lane."

"It's also poor."

"Well, that's the thing. I think most people's knowledge of Somalia, if you're young—even if you're older—is probably from the movie 'Black Hawk Down.'"

"Yeah."

"Which I have not seen."

"You've never seen 'Black Hawk Down'?"

"I've never seen it. I thought about watching it for this, and then I was like, I'm good."

"I watched it."

"You did?"

"I did."

"Well, I've seen it before."

"Is it Ridley Scott, right?"

"I don't know. It's one of those guys."

"It's a guy with a lot of explosions."

"First of all, we'll get to that, I guess, when we talk about 'Black Hawk Down.' It never—it's always funny because one of the heroes in the movie was, of course, in real life—they're all based on real people, or most of them—was immediately... but it's like, God, it is crazy racist. It's just like—"

"Oh, yeah."

"It is really like a movie that's like, check out these black savages over here."

"Jesus Christ."

"It's like that, and it's saying 'black' in that way."

"Yeah."

"Then suddenly it'll show a mom with her kids. It's like, oh, she's one of the good ones. It's crazy. But, you know, I've seen it a few times. I know what happened during the 'Black Hawk Down' incident. But the movie still is kind of just like—it's kind of hard to actually follow what's going on. It's like, well, why do you guys keep driving back in there to get these guys?"

"Well, probably because the U.S. mission was pretty confused."

"I think in that way, it does function as an amazing metaphor for the United States' invasion of Somalia and Mogadishu."

"So when I say it's poor, what I mean is that it is massively under-industrialized and underdeveloped. As of right now, it doesn't export more than a billion dollars' worth of commodities, and its top four agricultural products are just different types of milk. It is just very, very underdeveloped."

"And I don't mean that as like—I'm saying this is because it has been a playground for colonial powers since, I don't know, the 16th century."

"Yeah."

"No, I mean, that's—again, Somalia is oftentimes the butt of jokes, like, oh, if you want a libertarian government, move to Somalia, because it doesn't really have—well, traditionally in the past 30 years, hasn't had much of a functioning government."

"Yeah."

"You know, it's very poor. There's a lot of people who are basically have to live nomadic—I mean, they have for a long time—but like nomadic existences. The cities are all messed up."

"Yeah."

"It's just like—it's sort of like the definitional failed state."

"Yes. And yet it is resource-rich, which, you know, I do want to—you know, it has iron ore, copper, salt, all of these things. We will end up talking about this later, not in these two episodes, but it also has the potential to be very resource-rich in oil and gas."

"Yeah."

"Which is an important thing to remember."

"So we got to talk about the colonial history here a little bit. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those podcasts where we're going to be like, back in—we can't talk about the entire history of Somalia and Africa. You know, sometimes they do that in podcasts. We're like, in this time—we just—there's too much."

"We can't do that in this case."

"No, we're going to be moving through this as quick as we can. The first guys to show up, though, were the Portuguese in the 16th century. This prompts the Ottomans to kind of come over and help the Somali people fight back before the Ottomans kind of take over the joint, which is when they're the ones to kind of set up the strategically important ports, specifically in Mogadishu through the 19th century."

"Yeah, basically Somalia is kind of like a collection of sultanates and what could essentially be called city-states, I guess. But, you know, like a lot of different places, there are different clans that have different control over different places. Obviously, it's not like highly urbanized or anything like that. There are population centers, but a lot of the population lives kind of semi-nomadically. And then along the coast, there are these sort of small sultanates that aren't centralized in a government or anything like that."

"Which, you know, fairly typical for a lot of countries that got colonized."

"It's around this time that the British come calling, which kind of was happening everywhere. They had already just—they had just set up control over the Gulf of Aden, and they obviously were like, oh, let's take over the adjacent lands so we can maintain this incredibly important, like you said, trade corridor that connects Egypt to India."

"Yes. I'm sorry, I just always have to say—"

"She's doing the Brits."

"No, no, that's good. And by the way, when we say 'India' like that, we are doing British colonial guy talk. That's the accent that we're doing."

"That is it."

"'India.'"

"'India.'"

"Yeah, that's free."

"'Passage to India,' great book."

"We've gotten so far. Now we're at the Berlin Conference. That's how quickly we are moving through this. It's 1884, and this is when the colonial powers decide to divide up Africa. Now, again, for the purposes of this show, let's just talk about the Horn."

"The Horn of Africa."

"I mean, France takes Djibouti, Britain moves next door to what was called Somaliland, Italy gets what's now called Eritrea and southeastern Somalia in what was previously controlled by the Ottomans, and then Ethiopia is left independent, which annoys the Italians."

"It should be noted here that Italy didn't wholesale colonize and incorporate Somalia as an Italian territory, like legally administer all of this. They didn't do all of that at once. What they did is kind of classic colonial style: it's divide and conquer, but they also just go to different sultanates and be like, we'll give you this deal, we'll sign this deal with you, we'll buy this town, we'll buy this town from you. So they go around sort of collecting treaties, which are useless to anyone who is actually from Somalia, but to the Italians give them this legal cover essentially to start colonizing. They start sending colonists as well, although that gets going with greater fervor later."

"Yeah, I mean, another thing to note too, and you kind of talked about this, but just to kind of hammer it home, people who are considered to be ethnic Somalis—meaning share a culture, religion, a language—they're often divided up by clans, like you said, and those clans got further divided up by the ensuing colonial occupation, which is to say that there is a very long history of division and tribalism among the total population of ethnic Somalis, which is a conflict that just only gets exacerbated by the colonial occupation."

"I mean, that is classic. That's like, listen, if you're going to be a colonial guy, you've got to do that, right? You've got to do your thing. What you really want to do is you want to find a small but not minuscule either religious or ethnic minority and put them in charge of everybody. And if you can't do that, you kind of just got to flare up tensions wherever you can. I mean, that's just—I'm not giving advice to anyone listening to that. I'm just saying that's kind of the playbook that they all went to."

"So the Somali people don't care much for the colonial occupation. Surprise, surprise. Resistance movements pop up. Different tribal clans are assassinating Italian leaders. The big one is the Dervish movement led by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, also known as the Mad Mullah, which I think is the nickname that the British gave him."

"Really sounds like a British—"

"Well, yeah, because he was fighting them too."

"Yes."

"Because they were like, oh my God, isn't he so crazy? He hates colonialism."

"He's mad."

"Which does feel very British."

"He is a Somali national hero. The Dervish movement kind of comes together as the French are trying to come in and convert everyone to Catholicism, and they are like, no. And this is sort of the outline of one of the earliest nationalist movements for Somalia. He declares war on the colonial powers in 1899 and any and all collaborators and fights a very successful 20-year war against the British and the Italians."

"The British can't get him. They are really bad at it."

"It's a really great example of early guerrilla warfare where he and the Dervish armies that he had assembled were hiding in caves and doing all this kind of guerrilla-style warfare, and the British, with their massive arsenal, including machine guns and such, can't get to him until, unfortunately, they got Gatling guns at that point. I guess it would be—"

"Well, they do finally get him, unfortunately, in 1920 with the advent of air power, and they just take it all out."

"I think I've talked about this book before, and this book at this point, actually, I'm a little sick of this book, but that book 'Human Smoke' has a really good kind of early history of British use of air warfare, especially against Africans and Arabs. I mean, famously, Winston Churchill, the gassing air, all that stuff."

"We got to talk about the Italians for a second here. Well, actually, we got to talk about the Italians for like ten more hours, but we have to start talking about the Italians here."

"So again, the Italians have control over southeastern Somalia. It's a lot of the coastal stuff. They're not too far inland there, and their control is basically limited to these little outposts that they have there. They technically control much more area, but really you control where your guys are basically, and back then they didn't have too many guys there."

"However, the Dervish movement collapses in the early '20s, and the Italians are like, oh, hello, hello, hello, because back up in Italy, a little—not so little—preening, corpulent figure named Mussolini decides, listen, we Italians have had it too good for too long. I'm about to treat you guys some discipline, and we're going to have such a good 20 years until we immediately surrender basically a week after foreigners come into the country during World War II and switch sides, and then do 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin.'"

"So Mussolini comes to power in 1926. He marches on Rome. King Vittorio is like, oh, I guess, yeah, do whatever you want there. But he was not alone on that march. It was kind of like the Million Man March, except significantly less people than that, and they weren't black people, but guys wearing black shirts. And one of those guys with a black shirt was a guy named Cesare Maria De Vecchi. He was a particularly brutal black shirt, and by the way, for those who didn't pay attention in whatever class they teach this in, the black shirts were the fascists."

"Every country had a little shirt, and then they ran out of colors, and it got very confusing."

"Very difficult, because somehow America got stuck with the silver shirts, and I'm like, that's not going to cut it. But one of the guys who helped organize the march on Rome was Cesare Maria De Vecchi. He was the leader of the Turin squad, which is basically like their stormtroopers, I guess that's the easiest analogy, but like their fascist gang that killed everybody, black shirt terror gang. Mussolini, though, he's like, now he's in power, he's kind of trying to go legit. He gets embarrassed when his guys kill that famous socialist guy. He's like, oh no, I'm a real dude or whatever, I'm not just a terrorist or whatever. And so he's like, De Vecchi, we're sending your ass to Africa. And De Vecchi's like, ah, well, he had been the perpetrator of this big massacre, killed a bunch of people in Turin, and so he's like, okay, I guess I've been a naughty boy, I'll go down to Africa. And he also had his own little power base, and so they get him out of there."

"So De Vecchi gets down there, he's like, all right, well, my experience so far has been hanging anarchists in Turin, now I'm in charge of pacifying the sultans of Somalia. And so, okay, first thing I gotta do is I gotta go to the sultanates and I gotta disarm them. I just gotta make sure that they don't have any guns, so if I try, if they try to, they can't do anything, right? Because I've heard about this Dervish guy, or the Dervish movement, or the mad mullah, I don't really want to mess with anything like that."

"So he's Italian, and I gotta tell you, I mean no disrespect to the Italian people, that means he immediately fails. Setback after setback, humiliation after humiliation, there are mutinies, there are battlefield defeats. His methods grow more brutal—bombing entire villages, destroying entire families. Italy eventually rolls over the sultanates—it takes him like three or four years. So he gets there, I think, like 1924, takes him back to like 1927 to ostensibly get full control over the area he was trying to get control of."

"Late 1920s, it gets a little more formalized there. They start importing more colonists from Italy, they set up some infrastructure projects. They actually, in terms of building stuff, they do kind of a better job than the Brits. I mean, I'm not defending Italian colonialism in Somalia, I'm just saying they do build a lot of stuff there."

"Which becomes important later in this story."

"Yeah. One of the things, by the way, they build was concentration camps, where they put people and then starve them to death. They also build big slave plantations, because Italians had, up until this point, never heard of the wonderful fruit called the banana. And they start growing bananas in Somalia—huge banana plantations that are run by Italian colonists, often staffed with forced labor—in order to bring the fruits of the colonies home under the slogan 'Bananas, Bread of the Gods.' And I'm not kidding, I read this entire paper, which I will admit was basically a waste of time. It's a good paper, but really not necessary for the show, because basically that's one point that I'm making. Italy went crazy over bananas in the '30s."

"So they never heard of bananas?"

"I'm confused by the comparison to bread. Were they making banana sandwiches? Were the bananas the bread of the sandwich as opposed to the inside?"

"You'd think that. No."

"But they were making banana bread?"

"No, but they were making like—there was some kind of Somali—you can make like a kind of banana flour."

"Okay, yeah."

"But really, when they're talking about 'Bread of the Gods,' they're talking about bananas themselves. It's just a slogan they made up, but they pretended that bananas were—it was kind of like an early Huberman-style, not Huberman, but like a superfood thing, like whatever a goji berry is. Bananas were—it's like it's a superfruit or whatever."

"Bananas were goji berries to Italians in the 1930s."

"Bananas are kind of a superfruit, though. They're very good for you."

"They're my favorite fruit."

"That's what the opening to 'Gravity's Rainbow' is about."

"Bananas."

"So this is all kind of what will soon be revealed as Mussolini's grand plan for Italian East Africa. So they gobble up Somalia—not the British part—but they gobble up Italian Somalia, so parts of what is now Somalia, a lot of the coastal stuff. But Mussolini is like, 'Damn, there's a big country—like real country—next to this one called Ethiopia,' which very famously had never been conquered, is ruled—it's an independent country. And Ethiopia at this time actually holds a pretty important place for black people, both in America and in Africa, because it's like it is ruled by black people. It's a dictatorship by Haile Selassie. It is not run entirely well, and Ethiopians were not always so welcoming towards Africans from other parts of Africa. But as a—there's a huge spiritual importance to like, this is like the—we have the Negus here. We have this black king who is in charge of a black kingdom."

"Mussolini is like, 'Forget that.' And so Haile Selassie is obviously like, 'Listen, all these white men coming into Africa—they've been coming into Africa for a while—but they're really kind of coming up against Ethiopia's borders here.' He's like a little nervous. There's been clashes between troops. He's kind of freaked out about Italy's abutment of Ethiopia in Somalia there. This is a very famous—one of the incidents where people—you know, the League of Nations—for those who don't know, the League of Nations was kind of like, well, they really tried to do a U.N., and it went really bad. Sadly, this is in the interwar period. It was like the U.N., but had no army and no—actually no consequences. It was just kind of a place where you could go and be like, 'This guy's invading me,' and everyone could be like, 'That's so messed up, man. I'm sorry.'"

"Ethiopia keeps going and being like, 'This dude's about to invade me. This dude's about to invade me.' Mussolini invades, and he's at the League of Nations, and he's like, 'Dude, he's invading me. I thought this was like we were supposed to prevent this kind of stuff.' Everyone's like, 'Yeah, but, you know, we're—it's the mid-'30s.' Britain and France are like, 'Actually, we're kind of trying to make sure that he still stays with the Allies, so good luck.' And he actually—I will say the Italians are so bad at fighting war—it takes them kind of a long time to—Ethiopia has—they have guns. They're buying guns from Nazi Germany. They have an unarmed air force staffed actually with some fascist Belgian and black American pilots. It's very strange."

"Interesting."

"Yeah, I read a book about it like a year ago. I read part of a book about it like a year ago. It's very strange. It's part of these weird mercenary formations that formed in the 1930s. But the Italians use mustard gas, machine guns. There's all these massacres. And Mussolini, for the first and only time in his entire—well, I'll say for the first time, not technically the only time because I guess they did take over Albania—occupies and—or takes over and occupies a country."

"So again, we're skipping over some history here, but World War II—the war to end all wars—or that was World War I."

"Yeah, well, whatever."

"Neither."

"So it doesn't matter which one it was because it was kind of a bunch of nonsense. World War II happens. There's a bunch of fighting in East Africa. So blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You guys know who won World War II. It was not the Italians. Although actually, technically, they did because they did switch sides in like 1943. But the Italian territory in Somalia is actually given back to the Italians after World War II by the fledgling United Nations as like a trusteeship that Italy is supposed to watch over and nurture into a democracy, which, by the way, Italy itself had just had forced upon it by an invasion of half the world into its shores. But they were like, 'Oh yeah, you can nurture democracy there and build up a country, and then you can kind of let them go.' But it was also like a way for Italy to get back into the good graces of everybody, like, 'Can you handle this? We'll handle everything else.'"

"So Somalia finally gains independence in 1960, and the first government is this coalition of the north and south, the former Italian and British territories. So again, we are really glossing over a lot here, but the colonial boundaries of the state remain. So this has been a problem kind of all over the world with every kind of person since countries and lines and stuff like that were invented—is sometimes you've got guys who are part of your ethnicity, but they're technically in a different country, right?"

"Yeah."

"Germans were very exercised over this."

"Of course, the wars kind of ever."

"But the colonial boundaries remained in place when Somalia gained its independence, meaning a lot of ethnic Somalis were actually in different countries. And the big sticking point that we actually need to pay attention to here is that there are some in Ethiopia, and there's also some Ethiopians in Somalia."

"Yes."

"And this can cause us some problems down the line here."

"There's an enmity between the two nations."

"So 1969, a guy named Mohamed Siad Barre was a general in the Somali army, overthrows the highly contested first independent government. So he had been trained, like almost everybody who is from Somalia who we will talk about in the remainder of this series, in Italy at military academies, learned the language. And he later became a self-proclaimed Marxist. So when he assumes power in 1969 in the coup, he announces right away that Somalia is going to pursue a Soviet-inflected scientific socialist program, which he inaugurates with a massive public works program to develop the country, kind of with Soviet developmentalism."

"Yes."

"He's not great at it."

"No, he isn't."

"Can you explain a little bit why—I think for a lot of people there's this idea that, I don't know, all of it is either just bad—like people who pretended to be socialist but weren't actually, or didn't—or maybe were conflicted about how to work with the Soviet Union. I don't know. Can you explain? Because it's a complicated situation."

"Yeah, I mean, we actually get to see in this part of the world and in Yemen, in Ethiopia and Somalia, sort of like different versions of this play out, right? But Soviet assistance with governments that kind of essentially go from colonial, or in the case of Ethiopia, feudal governments, to socialist governments, kind of like at the drop of a hat, which is a military officer's cap, which you throw off as you pull your pistol to do a military coup, right?"

"Yes."

"I think a lot of the problems kind of stem from something that the Soviet Union itself struggled with was the problem of the peasantry, right? And the problem—the reality that capitalism had not developed in any of these countries, right? Like either they were kept underdeveloped on purpose by colonial administrators, or again, like in the case of Ethiopia, you know, like it was like a feudal country. I mean, basically all of these countries are feudal, which isn't to say that like Russia had a very poorly developed capitalism, but it still had capitalism. Like there was still a proletariat when Russia had its revolution, right? Famously."

"Yeah, very famously it did."

"Somalia did not exactly have a proletariat. And also a lot of these clans—excuse me—a lot of these countries had very developed clan systems."

"Right, which we talked about."

"Yeah, exactly. And those had been left in place by the colonial powers and were still very much existing and feuding with each other."

"Yes."

"Even as the kind of new independence—quasi-independent states were kind of forming."

"Yeah, yeah."

"Yeah, exactly. I mean, we saw this—you see this in Yemen, you saw this in Ethiopia, you see this in—this is not limited to this part of the world either."

"Right, right, right."

"And you see this in Somalia, right? So like you have—and in fairness, they try to overcome this at first."

"Yeah, there's like a try—they're like, let's moonshot it, let's speedrun it."

"Yeah, but he doesn't really like—but Barre is not a very capable leader at all, and he does eventually, and especially towards the end of his tenure, really exploit the clan system, like plays different clans against each other. There's a famous Isaaq genocide. And yeah, it just—it is one of those things that like, it's a tough nut to crack, and the Soviets seem really incapable of cracking it. In fact, like oftentimes grew frustrated with a lot of like the third world leaders that they had to deal with because of this stuff that was in place. But that's also a lot of the problem with having basically military coups that bring socialism to power. Not that I'll ever say no to one, but I mean, just from looking at the many cases that has happened in history, especially Africa is kind of where that happened the most. Oftentimes, like there was not this like revolutionary—I mean, yeah, it's just—it's tough. And so the clan system was essentially left in place and in hibernation—not even hibernation, like it was kind of just like something that was allowed to grow and grow and grow until it started infecting the state. The Soviets get too frustrated and just end up pulling out completely and throw all their weight behind Ethiopia."

"Well, that's the other thing too. So obviously, Haile Selassie gets overthrown by officers in his own country, the Derg, who are fighting against Maoist rebels and a bunch of other rebels—Eritreans, blah, blah, blah. Again, too much to get into here. But the Soviets actually at this point are supporting Yemen, they're supporting Ethiopia, and they're supporting Somalia. And the Somalis and the Ethiopians—Somalia attacks Ethiopia in 1978, the Ogaden War, because there's like a little bit of Ethiopia that kind of like gets its own Horn of Africa into Somalia."

"Well, and remember, ethnic Somalis are kind of all over the place."

"Yes."

"And a lot of them are in Ethiopia."

"Yes."

"And so they want to kind of come back in and want to use that as pretext of going over there to get them in. You know, it's classic."

"Not an uncommon thing. And at different points, like still now basically, Ethiopians fund Ethiopian groups in Somalia that fight against the government and Somali groups that fight against the government. And Somalia funded Ethiopian groups that fought against the government in Ethiopia. So we have these like two Soviet-supported governments fighting each other, but Somalia is clearly the aggressor here. The Soviets are like, 'What the heck, dude? We're out.' They pull—not only do they pull all their guys and their weapons from Somalia, they just give them to Ethiopia. And Ethiopia smokes them. I mean, they really decimate Barre."

"I was reading a book of Barre's speeches. I think it's from like '83. And this is—I took a little part of one. They're not very good speeches. But he says, 'At the same time, we were in disagreement with the Soviet Union, for the Soviets thought our type of socialism was different from their type of socialism. Our differences with the Soviets were not limited to the type of our socialism, but also extended to other areas, for we had different views on a number of international issues and the future of this region of ours and its security.' That is code word for 'We invaded a country next to ours and lost really badly, and the Soviets did not like that.' Fidel Castro called Barre a chauvinist who used socialism as a shell. And really, once the Soviets pull support, Barre is like—he still kind of claims to be like a scientific socialist or whatever, but he's like, 'U.S., Italy, NATO, all you guys, what's up? I'm your friend now.'"

"Yeah. Well, that's another classic move."

"One thing I have to mention about the Ogaden War, too, is the Safari Club gets involved. So you might remember these guys from our 9/11 episode—the network of spy agencies headed by a French count and head of the SDECE, plus Saudi Arabia, Egypt—who sent Somalia American equipment via Saudi intermediaries, including, of course, the uncle of a certain Washington Post reporter who got killed in an embassy in Turkey—Khashoggi."

"So he blows the war. Barre is isolated. He's in the middle of a legitimacy crisis. And you mentioned this, but this is when he's encouraging all the clans to kind of go at each other—classic divide and rule move—to sort of distract them, right? This only worked for so long. Eventually, the clans are like, 'Forget this.' They unite in their opposition, and they join up with Islamists who have been kind of fighting against the regime separately, kind of like internally. We haven't really talked about that yet. It's a little complicated, but we're going to just move through it. But together, they all force the collapse of the central government. This leads us into the early '90s in Somalia. And it's important to note that this is also happening as the Soviet Union is collapsing, or in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union."

"So one of the things that was so important about Somalia and the Horn of Africa during the Cold War is that the U.S. and also the Soviets both wanted to prevent essentially the use of it as a launchpad for their opposing blocs' operations against each other, because it's such an important strategic place that once the Soviets pulled out, the U.S., while they never were super—they didn't support Barre as openly as the Soviets did, they definitely did support him, and they kind of just both wanted to block each other from using anything."

"Yeah. They didn't really want to use Somalia anymore as a policeman for the Horn—the U.S., right? When the Soviets collapsed, because they were like, 'Well, now we don't have to prop up this thing, which is kind of a boondoggle,' they love to say, as it is. And oh, perfect opportunity for the Americans to come in and say, 'Oh, we don't support the Barre regime. Look at all these horrible human rights abuses,' even though they've been propping it up for so long. Classic, classic. And so when Barre loses U.S. support, all of the clans led by various warlords are able to overthrow the regime, and Somalia basically just descends into chaos, because there's a massive, massive power vacuum. And when we say chaos, I mean like literally it's chaos. All state institutions almost like overnight just crumble, and various clans and non-state actors have to step up to provide basic services, if they were going to provide any at all. And something to kind of point out that we might return to at a later point is that a lot of the kind of Islamic groups restored a lot of law and order in the zones that they were in charge of, and they start providing a lot of essential health care, like basic education—things that the state just doesn't exist at this point—law and order."

"Yeah, and this was really, really welcomed by a lot of Somali people, understandably."

"So now we've made it—1992. The U.S. launches a multinational military intervention. This is what they love to call the U.N.-backed coalition. This was the United States' war. This was led by the U.S. They kind of tried to hide behind the U.N. and this idea of a coalition. It's really not that many big nations. It was the U.S."

"Well, it was definitely—especially at first, it was the U.S., right? Because the U.N. Security Council approves—I think it's Resolution 751—and they're like, 'We've got to disarm everybody, or we've got to disarm non-state actors,' which is like everybody at this point. And we have to ensure the smooth delivery of humanitarian aid. But it's going to take us a while to get this force together, and the U.S. is like, 'We can invade tomorrow. We've got it. We're on Desert Storm, so we're ready to rock. We're already in the area. We'll send the Marines to Mogadishu.'"

"Yeah, and I think there's an image of the U.S. kind of just landing on these airstrips and then sort of standing by as U.S. troops sort of carry in boxes and boxes of aid in Mogadishu. That's kind of what people think. But like you mentioned, there's that second mission, which was authorizing U.S. forces to disarm all of the various Somali militias. And there are so many different clans and their attending militias that inevitably that will lead to the U.S. favoring some over others as they're trying to disarm them and manage the political situation."

"Well, there was this coalition—I mean, there were multiple coalitions, actually—but there was one main coalition that was fighting against Barre in the civil war. Once they kind of take Mogadishu, Barre splits, the country—they fracture."

"Right."

"There are two different sides, and the U.S. decides that one of them is kind of public enemy number one, and that's one guy named Mohammed Farah Aidid."

"This mission did not go well."

"No, no."

"I think if people do know anything about Somalia, they probably know about this. Like we said, this gets us into the 'Black Hawk Down' incident."

"'Black Hawk Down.'"

"A bunch of civilians were killed in U.S. airstrikes as they were hunting for Aidid. There were clan leaders, religious leaders, businessmen there that were working on U.N.-brokered peace deals—a bunch of popular intellectuals. A ton of people were killed as the U.S. was attempting to go after this guy. And they were all people there who were trying to end the war. So this caused a huge backlash, predictably, right? Any and all foreigners started being targeted, including Western journalists and U.N. relief workers. And U.S. troops, surprised by ambushes, started to view regular Somali citizens as potential threats and then started to treat them as such. This is a situation getting out of control."

"Yeah, and I think what's so galling about the Somalia stuff is that things were not going well there, right? There was a really brutal civil war, tons of droughts, there was mass starvation. And the intervention was like, 'Oh, we're going to protect all this aid coming in.' But the intervention is just as much madness as anything else. They come in there and they just start slaughtering people. I mean, literally, I think we'll talk about this a little more in the next episode, but basically every major country—I don't think Germany does—but Canada, Italy, the U.S.—all come in there and all of these major incidents where they kill a bunch of people."

"So this all culminates in 'Black Hawk Down.' This is October 1993. U.S. Army and Delta Force troops raided one of Aidid's compounds in Mogadishu. His guys shoot down two Black Hawk helicopters. They crash into the street where children are playing. Crowds swarm to attack the surviving U.S. soldiers and the guys that are sent in to rescue them. Eighteen American soldiers are killed, one of them famously hogtied up, dragged through the streets. This pales in comparison to the hundreds of Somali men, women, and children that were killed in the violence that followed. And that's not even talking about what happened before 'Black Hawk Down.'"

"But just months prior to this, the Italians—because that's really who we're focusing on—they had faced a big battle of their own."

"It is with the utmost regret that I have to inform you that Italy's first battle since the end of World War II is called the Battle of Checkpoint Pasta. Now, I just want to say really quick, there's a lot of Italians in this story, and they have very funny names. It is hard for me—I mean no disrespect, because I like Italy."

"I love Italians."

"You and I are both Italian."

"Sure."

"Full-blooded Italians. Look, it's hard for me to take something seriously when you name naval boats 'Stromboli.' This story is particularly tough—the Battle of Checkpoint Pasta—because it's actually—there are two checkpoints involved in it. Obviously, Checkpoint Pasta is the main one, but the other one is Checkpoint Faro."

"The ancient grain."

"The ancient grain Faro. The Italians are the second-biggest force in Somalia next to the Americans. And from what I can gather—and I read kind of a lot—but from what I can understand, the entire U.N. force that were there—and there was a bunch of countries, Pakistan, there was a ton of people there—were not coordinated very well. It was supposed to be coordinated by the Americans. In fact, that was a big point of contention between the Americans and the Italians. They were like, 'Let all the guys coordinate a little bit.' But the Americans were like, 'No. No, no, no. We're good.'"

"So the Italians are doing a raiding mission backed up by Somali policemen who were apparently unknown to the Italians, loyal to, I guess, Mahdi—like one of the presidents of Somalia, the nominal president of Somalia, like a former member—the other guy, basically, that Aidid was fighting against. And I guess he's technically the government, so the policemen would technically work for him. And people did not like that, because people didn't like, you know, the rival warlords—the people in the territory of Aidid—were kind of more loyal to him, I guess. They were like, 'Why you got these other guys' warlord guys in our spot? They're coming to our houses, they're taking our guns, and there's guns everywhere, right? There's guns everywhere. Believe me, we're going to talk about that. Sixty-four percent of Somalis had at least one gun, which is a lot. Like an American high school!'"

"So they're doing this weapons confiscation raid. Aidid is like, 'Okay, well, this is an act of war. You've got your guys in there. You're in my territory.' They ambush an Italian column while it was between Checkpoint Faro and Checkpoint Pasta, which they say—the Italians say—was named such because it was an old Barilla—you know, like the pasta factory nearby. I'm just guessing you named it that because it reminded you of home. However, there is a pasta factory by there, and Aidid's—in a grievous insult to the Italians—Aidid's men are firing mortars at the Italians from the pasta factory."

"It's terrible, because in my head, I just imagine explosions of spaghetti. I know, like, there's still pasta there."

"Yeah, and it's just going everywhere."

"Sauce over everybody's face."

"'Mamma mia!'"

"Kind of, yeah."

"The Italians pour fire into there. They retreated—three dead Italians, twenty-something Italians wounded—and they're like, 'Okay, also, free-fire zone for helicopters.' And so all these helicopter gunships come in and just shoot everybody that moves. That's one thing that, like, I'm sure there's so many incidents of that that we don't even know about, that the Americans or the Italians would be like—they would take fire from somewhere, they would have some kind of battle, they would be confused, they would leave, and they'd be like, 'This area is now a free-fire zone. Anybody in that area is an enemy combatant.' And so, like, just kill them."

"Interestingly enough, though, the reason that we're even mentioning this whatsoever—not just because it has to do with the Italians—is because it ties into our story. Well, this all ties into the story. Unfortunately, this is all background that we have to give to even get us to the murder. But there is possibly a more connection here. You should remember this name. The Italian army records Aidid's militiamen rearming at a house owned by an Italian named Giancarlo Marocchino."

"Now, I learned this from an Italian Senate report reporting on Italy's army staff communications during the battle. Interestingly enough, in that report it also mentions intercepts from Aidid's staff that show that Giancarlo Marocchino, who is often called 'The Moroccan,' but who is, in fact, an Italian, was facilitating the training of Aidid's men with MANPADs in Iran."

"Yeah."

"We're going to talk a lot about Giancarlo, but not yet. I do want to say here, though, like, these incidents—the Battle of Checkpoint Pasta, 'Black Hawk Down,' the Bloody Monday raid, which we'll talk about, I guess, in the next episode—like, these incidents essentially lead to everybody being like, 'Ah, mission accomplished! Time to leave Somalia!'"

"Yes. So that happens in 1994, the year of the murder. And it's a Joe Biden-esque exit, we'll say. They literally just—everyone's, like, packing up, going, but also, like you say, declaring victory. Not only is a huge political and social vacuum left in the wake, but a ton of understandable resentment as well, right? And not just from the Somalis, though we'll talk about that. It turns out, of course, the Italians were pretty annoyed too."

"According to journalist Michael Maren, who we're going to refer to a bunch in this, and this is a quote from him: 'The Italians felt that they had been dissed in Somalia. This was, after all, their former colony. They had a 100-year relationship with the place. But Operation Restore Hope was, at its core, an American show. They pouted and sulked and took more than a little delight in the problems the Americans later encountered in their ill-fated hunt for Aidid.'"

"I think that's a pretty fair assessment, yeah."

"It is."

"Although I think a 100-year relationship is kind of glossing over some things."

"No, I meant the pouting and sulking, but yeah."

"Yes, it's true. I mean, in the '80s, Italy used Somalia basically as a massive money-laundering destination. They would send trillions of lira in 'aid' just to have it go straight to the pockets of various Italian businessmen and government officials who were setting up highway projects, for example, and they would make them massive, massive slush funds. Kind of like classic—it feels very, very classic—but the Italians really—it's really weird. It's like they still viewed Somalia as part of their country."

"Yes."

"This is again from Maren: 'The biggest scam projects in Somalia were in the northeast near Bosaso. One of those projects involved the construction of a first-rate highway built through the desert linking Bosaso to Somalia's main road. One of the main beneficiaries of that road, and of the slush fund around the project, was a man who was very active in the area, who went by Giancarlo.'"

"Okay. So that highway has troubled me a little bit because I was like, 'Listen, I think it's good to build a highway.'"

"Sure."

"And because every time I read about this highway, this highway is kind of a famous highway as like a boondoggle sort of highway. But I'm like, 'I think it's actually good that the Italians built a highway there.' But the highway cost like $250 million, and it's basically just a road in the desert. You're telling me this highway cost $250 million?"

"$250 million."

"This is from a Washington Post piece from 1993, which really kind of goes over a lot of the more famous wasteful aid projects. But, 'Control over the aid and development projects was shared by all the political parties in exactly the same way that all the jobs in the vast public and semi-public sector were divided up. Ethiopia, another former Italian colony in the Horn of Africa, was awarded to the Christian Democrats. The Socialist Party got Somalia.' Now, I want to make it very clear that basically that is correct."

"Yes."

"But the Socialist Party of Italy—which, for those who might just hear the word 'socialist' and be like, 'Wow, they must be the good guys'—they are pieces of trash! And if you've listened to any episodes that we've ever done on Italy, you will know that the Italian Socialist Party are corrupt bums who should have all been shot in 1994, if not 1944!"

"I feel like we've talked about this in the episodes on the Mafia, absolutely, but also in the episodes about NATO."

"Yes."

"And Gladio, obviously."

"Yes. The reality is the Somalis were close to the Communists—the Communist Party of Italy—before the Ogaden War and maybe the geopolitical situation changed a little bit. And then, once the Italian Communists were like, 'You guys, you attacked Ethiopia? Why?' The Socialist Party were like, 'Hey, we're like the Communists, except we don't believe in Communism, and we are also the Mafia. Why don't you guys come hang out with us?' And the government of Barre was like, 'You guys sound great! There's way more money here!'"

"Very famous leader of the Italian Socialist Party of Italy, also Prime Minister, Bettino Craxi."

"The corrupt Craxi."

"The corrupt Craxi. I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that. His own brother-in-law—and I think he was mayor of Milan—Paolo Pillitteri—Craxi's brother-in-law—was the head of the Italy-Somali Chamber of Commerce, where all these deals went through. And there's some other connections to that, which we'll get to later too. And so, basically, all these massive public works projects in Somalia were done via the Socialist Party mixed with their good friends who you might know from popular media as the Mafia."

"Funnily enough, a lot of this came to light in 1989 when a man named Mohamed Farah Aidid sued the Italian Prime Minister for the 50 million lira he said he was promised in an Italian state bribery scheme—a revolving door of blowback that marks the Italians' time in Somalia."

"Yeah, we need to go back to Aidid for a second, because part of the reason the CIA had been tracking him for so long was that he had an uncanny ability to get weapons into Somalia and to his militias. Now, like we kind of mentioned, guns—they always flowed very easily into Somalia because Italy had always considered Somalia an extension of their own country. And so Barre, being a close ally of the Italian government, was constantly purchasing weapons from them and setting up weapons depots basically throughout the country. The former SISMI general—SISMI, by the way, is Servizio per le Informazioni e la Sicurezza Militare, which is military intelligence and security services. It's the military intelligence of Italy. So former SISMI general Giuseppe Santovito, who was also a member of P2—"

"The Masonic Lodge."

"Oh, the Masonic Lodge!"

"Yes, the illegal Masonic Lodge."

"Well, listen."

"I'm just saying."

"Illegal to who?"

"So Giuseppe spoke under oath about the huge supplies of weapons that went into Somalia from Italy, and we gotta say all of this was not, surprise, surprise, networked by the Mafia—specifically, the 'Ndrangheta. They operate out of the south of Italy. Now, we don't have—we're not going to go into a whole history with the Mafia."

"But we have!"

"Yes."

"An episode that I looked up earlier but forgot to write down the number of—269–270."

"269–270 with Matt from Ghost Stories for the End of the World. You can learn all about the 'Ndrangheta and the Mafia in those. In fact, those would be good to listen to if I had said this at the beginning of the episode."

"I think we did say this."

"Maybe we did say this. Those would be good to listen to."

"Yeah."

"To get some context on this stuff. Now, to give just a little bit to understand a little bit of the size that we're talking about here, Italian financial analysts estimated in 2021 that the 'Ndrangheta were worth about $22 billion. So to put that in perspective, that would be—in 2023 dollars, they would be right above the market cap of PayPal but just shy of Foxconn."

"Gotcha."

"That's how big these guys are, right? And they're not just pocketing cash selling weapons to warlords in Somalia or whatever. They have set up full-on trade lines, right? They connect different European government and shell companies with warlords, shipping lines, in a vast—at least for our purposes right now—a vast guns-for-waste trade circuit. And when I say waste, I mean toxic waste. Remember where Somalia is."

"Horn of Africa."

"Horn of Africa. How important it is right there, in between linking basically the continent of Europe through the Arab countries to India and out into East Asia."

"And Africa."

"And Africa, of course. It's very, very important right there."

"Now, a lot of reporting on what we're talking about here comes out of the testimony of a man named Francesco Fonti. He was a member of the 'Ndrangheta, pretty high up. He ended up doing about 50 years for drug trafficking, which is what turned him into a 'pentito,' a.k.a. collaborator with the Italian justice system. Now, he maintains that the 'Ndrangheta operated seamlessly in Somalia, basically brokering deals between Europeans looking to get rid of toxic waste and warlords on the other side looking for weapons for their militias. Fonti claims that he personally sank three ships off the coast of Italy in the Mediterranean in an effort to dump radioactive waste, and in return, the 'Ndrangheta received 100,000 lira for the job."

"It's not even that much money."

"It isn't, but that means—I think it's a lot of ships they were kind of sinking."

"I think they were. It seems like, while there's some controversy over Fonti's specific allegations sometimes, it is without a doubt that the Mafia was getting rid of toxic waste in less than legal ways. That is proven. It's not like conspiracy theory or anything like that. It's 100% proven. When he's talking about stuff like this, this is absolutely not—I don't think this guy is just talking out of his head."

"I do want to say, remember, Italy is not a nuclear powerhouse, so all of this radioactive waste is coming from somewhere else."

"I thought it was just their Italian stuff."

"No."

"Because of all the veal."

"In fact, in 2004, there was this huge tsunami that came, and it led to a bunch of unsealed waste containers coming up on shore. And this prompted this huge U.N. investigation into it, and they confirmed that there had been rampant dumping of toxic waste throughout the Mediterranean and off the coast of Africa, specifically off the coast of Somalia. And Greenpeace released copies of contracts signed by Italian companies with a Somali warlord giving the companies permission to dump 10 million tons for $80 million. The U.N. pointed out that a lot of this trade was brokered by the Mafia, especially the bigger, more established rackets, a.k.a. the 'Ndrangheta."

"This is a quote from some of the reporting: 'It was also mentioned that the Mafia were involved in guns and arms supplies to Somali warlords, and that these arms were also supplied in exchange or facilitation for dumping toxic waste.'"

"It is even widely believed that the Italian journalist Ilaria Alpi's discovery in the guns-for-waste trade between the Italian arms manufacturers and Somali militias is what led to her murder in Mogadishu in 1994."

"Now we're going to have a little more about the waste in a different episode, and about maybe one of the Italians who might be also the leader of a fake country who might have brokered some of these deals—like literally a fake country that he made up—but that's for another episode."

"We're now back to Alpi. Alpi allegedly got a tip about this trade line from a man named Vincenzo Li Causi, a member of the Italian military intelligence services. This is where we kind of start to lose our brain a little bit, but just a little bit."

"I think we should just read from the—this is from reporting in 1992. It's a translation, but it's from one of Italy's oldest and most-read newspapers. And it's called 'Trapani: Investigation into the Activities of the Scorpion.'"

"'What activity did the Scorpion Center carry out in Trapani between '87 and '89? One of the five operational sections of the 7th Division, the SISMI—the same one that Gladio depended on. In the city of a thousand mysteries, the deputy Francesco Messina has been investigating for seven months trying to find an answer to the question. The starting point of the investigation—the Trapani base of the Scorpion—is the apartment of office manager Vincenzo Li Causi, who lived with his wife and two children there for a couple of years. Then, as suddenly as he had arrived, he left. But there's no documentation of Li Causi. The man seems to have vanished into thin air. In short, a deep mystery.'"

"So the Scorpion Center was, according to investigations in Italy, a covert Gladio military structure."

"Some of this next stuff comes from a character named Francesco Elmo. Elmo was colleagues with a colonel in the military intelligence service who mysteriously turned up hanging from a bath rail by his own dressing gown cord after he started investigating into some of these networks."

"I don't totally know what to do with Elmo. This is, again, from some of the reporting: 'Arrested during the 'Check to Check' operation together with dozens of fixers, 'Cavalieri' and Freemasons, Elmo immediately began to tell the various behind-the-scenes stories of the trafficking and his strange collaborative relationship with the SISMI. At first, everyone thought that the almond-eyed Sicilian was crazy, who in his stories mixed up conventional and nuclear weapons trafficking, complicated money-laundering systems, CIA agents, Calabrian criminals, currency operations capable of putting the economies of entire nations in difficulty, political projects of deviant Freemasonry. He spent 12 hours smoking cigarette after cigarette and filling 14 pages of a report that raises the stakes of the previous ones, because it talks about a circle of companies registered to collaborators of the secret services and never touched by the investigation into the slush funds, and mentions the deaths without reason—the murder of Luigi Ilardo, who disappeared into thin air on July 2, 1995, and of Vincenzo Li Causi, killed during a shootout in Mogadishu on November 12, 1993.'"

"Now, something was mentioned in that—'Check to Check.'"

"Yes."

"Could you explain this to me?"

"Yeah, we're going to have to do a deeper dive into 'Check to Check.' But 'Check to Check' was the code name of a massive Italian police investigation in the '90s that attempted to unravel a weapons and nuclear waste smuggling network expanding across the Balkans and Ukraine, you know, over the span of the European continent down into the Mediterranean and into Africa. Now, the people implicated in the investigation included the Archbishop of Barcelona, the Grand Master of P2—"

"The Masonic Lodge."

"—and probably the source of the deviant Freemasonry that is described in that article, and a Russian ultra-nationalist named Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who was the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia."

"Which is, contrary to the name, like, insane ultra-nationalist."

"Yes."

"A longtime member of the Duma."

"Like, up until his death."

"And once called himself the Donald Trump of Russia before he died just two years ago."

"I think that's one of the things that has kind of messed me up about us doing this thing is that usually, you know, you're talking about stuff that happened a long time ago. We're talking about, you know, arms trafficking or networks from the '60s. Oh, we're talking about Jack Kennedy. A lot of people in this story are still alive."

"Yeah."

"Oh, yeah. Some of these people—one of the people that's like a central member of the story is, as far as I can tell, a member of Somalia's parliament."

"Yeah."

"So it gets a little tricky. But, you know, here's some from some reporting on 'Check to Check': 'The motley crew is named in connection with trafficking everything from Kalashnikovs to plutonium and recycling the profits through some surprising channels, including the Institute for Religious Works, better known as the Vatican Bank.'"

"Essential for anybody."

"Yeah."

"At least you're jelly."

"But like essential."

"Essential, essential, essential role in Gladio."

"Yes. Additionally, a former CIA agent named Roger D'Onofrio was arrested in conjunction with all of this. He had dual American and Italian citizenship. He was a CIA agent for at least, as far as we know, 40 years. He was arrested in conjunction with all this. His testimony from the '95 'Check to Check' investigation was presented during—and I swear to God, I'm sorry, this is a tangent, but I just had to do it—during the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, because it turns out that Roger was working with Charles Taylor, the convicted war criminal, you know, the former president of Liberia. They had a company together that was called International Business Consulting."

"That's really good."

"That's really good."

"They worked with Gaddafi."

"Okay. Well, now we've got one good guy we've named."

"And Taylor to form a rebel group in the Sierra Leone jungle. They had a diamond trade facilitated by a Liberian attaché who was actually Senegalese and fought with the Mujahideen in the '70s and '80s."

"Certainly not the only person who fought with the Mujahideen we'll be talking about in these episodes."

"And there's just so much more. There's so much more. But I just want to say D'Onofrio named an Italian businessman who he said was his point person on a lot of these trades. He only used the name Piccari. Now, my best guess is that is a Luciano Piccari described in Italian papers as a man 'on the border between crime and the services'—the intelligence services. He was a colleague of the colonel investigating the network—the one who was found hanging—the one who spooked Elmo into talking about Li Causi's death."

"So now we're back. Vincenzo Li Causi, Ilaria Alpi's contact. He was in Somalia a bunch in the '90s on behalf of SISMI. In fact, it is where he, like Ilaria, dies under mysterious circumstances."

"So he's killed in 1993 in an ambush in Balad during Ibis II, part of the second wave of the U.N.-backed intervention in Somalia. Mysteriously, some reports refer to his cause of death as 'friendly fire.' Regardless, the timing is suspect. In just a couple of days, back in Trapani to ministers as part of the ongoing Gladio investigations into activity in Sicily."

"Now, there is another weird aside to all of this. So, again, just to recenter everything."

"Again, like I said—"

"We're on a journey together."

"We're taking this journey, too."

"No, that's what I'm saying. We're all on this together."

"It's nice that we can do it together."

"Vincenzo Li Causi here is supposedly Ilaria Alpi's contact about this weird guns-for-waste smuggling operation that is happening in combination between some Somali warlords and some Italian warlords and the intelligence services. He is killed mysteriously in Mogadishu before Alpi is. However, his activities in Trapani have a weird connection to another sort of well-known unsolved murder that happened there. And just bear with me on this."

"So there's a loose end that has never actually really been neatly tied up, although there have been arrests made. But we'll talk about that when we get to it."

"So this is regarding a supposed friend of Vincenzo's, a man named Francesco Cardella. He was formerly the publisher of a magazine called 'Playmen,' which was a—"

"It was a porno."

"A porno magazine."

"He did a bunch of softcore porno magazines."

"But he was generally a big personality in Italy. He had models. He was married to a model. He had boats. He had money."

"He's Italian."

"He's Italian. He's like an Italian guy. He's kind of a liberal guy. You know, he's close to the Socialist Party. Ends up meeting a guy in the early 1980s named Mauro Rostagno. So Rostagno had been a member of Lotta Continua. He had, like many former rebels in both America and in Europe, turned to spirituality after the whole communist thing kind of lost a little bit of steam, especially in Italy. And with Cardella's money, he forms a drug rehab slash therapeutic community, which, by the way, the kind of thing that was pioneered by Synanon. So like all this stuff is, of course, going to be modeled after Synanon, especially this era, because it's really—that sort of thing has a lot of momentum behind it. It's a property—it's on Cardella's property, and it's called Saman, and it's modeled after the guru from 'Wild Wild Country.'"

"By the way, Cardella sold drugs prior to this. That's like how he got money. I'm not sure if he's still selling drugs, but he seems to be kind of a shady individual as evidenced by something that happens a little later. So I wouldn't put it completely out of your mind."

"Rostagno was found murdered in his car in 1988 near a disused airport. Now, the hypothesis is that he saw something being loaded into planes at that supposedly disused airport—something that he should not have seen—something that could have involved his friend Cardella or Cardella's pal Vincenzo Li Causi."

"So there's some strange kind of details here as well. So when this murder was being investigated, there were two tracks. There was an investigation of inside Saman—the drug rehab—focusing on Cardella, and there was an investigation outside, which ends up taking primacy because they do end up arresting eventually two Mafia guys for this murder, although it's never exactly clear why he was murdered."

"Yeah. That part gets suppressed."

"That part gets a little suppressed. So Saman is alleged to have two ships. Now, this is a drug rehab. Why do they have two boats? It's alleged—I mean, listen, I'm just going to put this out there. There is a huge possibility that there is something on this in Italian that I just—a lot of—all of actually the research that got into this had to be done in Italian. I do not speak a word of Italian besides the ones that I use whenever I talk to Italian people."

"We're doing our best with our friends at AI."

"That give us tools—robot tools."

"Yeah. In fact, I did—I used AI to translate quite a lot of long documents. And so it could very well be the case—like I'm saying this here—I don't have the answer to this. It could be the case that there is something here crucial that I'm missing. There's something that maybe every Italian knows about that I don't know about. I want to be upfront about that. If you can find out about this. But one thing I read in Italian paper was that they think what he saw was heroin being loaded on planes."

"Yes."

"And possibly guns as well."

"They usually go hand in hand."

"They go hand in hand. Well, if you've got a bunch of heroin, you've got to protect it."

"Got to have some heroin—couple guns too."

"So what the deal is with these ships? I have no idea. However, these ships are alleged to have maybe operated in or around Somalia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The entire thing is really strange. Elmo factors into this in some of the testimony here. It's hard to understand. But after Rostagno's murder, Cardella fully takes over the organization, becomes even richer, expands Saman to have all of these different treatment centers around Italy, and then there's a warrant issued for his arrest in 1995 for major fraud, and he flees to Nicaragua."

"Of course."

"And becomes really close to Daniel Ortega."

"I'm just calling it—I think he still might live in Nicaragua. He's not dead."

"Two Mafia guys were eventually arrested for Rostagno's murder, including one who had previously killed a magistrate investigating arms trafficking involving the Mafia and the Socialist Party. So one of the guys who was arrested for Rostagno's murder had admitted later that he had involvement in the bombing of a guy who was a government magistrate who was investigating the Mafia and the Socialist Party trafficking arms, which is exactly the same thing that we are alleging that Alpi was supposedly looking into that was happening in Somalia in the 1990s."

"There's a long Italian Senate report that was, I think, put together by—I didn't look up all the names, but the ones I did look up look to be like Democratic Party of the Left or like former—the Communist Party after they disgraced themselves by turning to Euro-Communism in Italy, then splintered into a thousand pieces, and one of those pieces was the—I think they called it the Democratic Party—I mean, parties in Italy change their name all the time."

"Yeah."

"Whatever. But they're left-wing senators put together this report. And I'm just going to read from it right here: 'The prosecutor's office of Trapani has acquired the statements of Francesco Elmo, a character who was proven to be unreliable in various judicial settings. From the complex investigations conducted by the public prosecutor of Trapani, the following emerges: Elmo, allegedly an external collaborator of parallel structures of SISMI—which means Gladio—claimed to have known Marshal Li Causi, who was mentioned, had directed the Scorpion Center in Trapani, the last Gladio center, for three years. Elmo also claimed to have learned that Marshal Li Causi was sent to Somalia to disrupt illegal arms and drug trafficking. According to Elmo, Marshal Li Causi had discovered that a large part of the military personnel present in Somalia belonged to Gladio and that a large arms and drugs trafficking operation was underway. The illicit trafficking was allegedly carried out with the cooperation of ships and also with two ships available to Francesco Cardella. Marshal Li Causi reportedly became good friends with Ilaria Alpi, to whom he confidentially revealed highly significant information. The ships used by the Saman community went to Somalia, where Cardella intended to open a hospital. A certain Camisa, known as Jupiter, Cardella's trusted man, was reportedly in Bosaso with a Saman ship on the days where Ilaria Alpi and Miran Hrovatin were also present shortly before their deaths. Camisa is said to have met Ilaria Alpi.'"

"I don't know what Camisa is supposed to mean there, but from the other reporting I've read is that Jupiter—which is Francesco Cardella's Camisa there—was like his driver, like his right-hand man."

"There is a message—an Italian SISMI message—that is later released. I believe it's also included in the Italian Senate report. The message reads: 'Due to anomalous presences in the Bosaso area, Jupiter ordered to return immediately to base one. Tactical movement ordered to Condor. Operational zone Bravo. Possible intervention.' Now, obviously that is done through a translator. There are other translations of the same message that basically, in slightly clearer but still like military tactical terms, seem to be ordering someone named Jupiter to leave the Bosaso area—which is where Ilaria Alpi was interviewing King Kong shortly before she was assassinated—and possibly ordering someone with the code name Condor to an operational zone for possible intervention."

"Now, to bring it back to Vincenzo for a second, it's still very unclear how Li Causi, Vincenzo Li Causi, died. But it's important that he was killed just months before Ilaria Alpi would be under equally unclear circumstances. And part of the reason why it's unclear what happened in her and Miran's death is because an autopsy was not performed immediately after they were shot, and pictures that were taken of the body are missing along with the medical report from the incident. So all of that is gone. Her parents had her body exhumed twice in order to get an autopsy done years later. The first one was inconclusive, which I'm not totally clear on what happened there. But the second one, which they did in 1998, had six doctors, and all of them concluded that Ilaria was not accidentally shot in an ambush along with others in a wild attack—which was kind of the main story at the time."

"Yeah, like the Somali savages just shot this white woman."

"'Black Hawk Down' style."

"Exactly. Now, the autopsy showed that she died from a single bullet to the back of her head, with the bullet grazing the tip of her finger, indicating that she may have been curled up holding the back of her head."
